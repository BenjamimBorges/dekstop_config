GRUB E OS PROBER
sudo apt install os-prober
sudo os-prober
sudo update-grub

os-prober is disabled by default. You’d have to enable it first. To do so:
Open /etc/defaults/grub as sudo to edit:
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
Look for the line starting with
#GRUB_ROOT_FS_RO
…and change it to
#GRUB_ROOT_FS_RO=true
As per the instructions.
Save, Ctrl+O → Y, and exit, Ctrl+X.
Update grub:
sudo update-grub
If successful, it should be safe to reboot, so do that and test.
Hope this helps!

# Uncomment this option to enable os-prober execution in the grub-mkconfig command
# GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

sudo update-grub
